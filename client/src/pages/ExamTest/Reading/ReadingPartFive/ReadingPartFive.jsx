									1. On 3 June 2010, an international crew of six
									astronauts entered a spaceship and prepared themselves
									for a 520-day voyage to the planet Mars and back. The
									module that was to be their home for the next year and
									a half contained their sleeping quarters, a
									kitchen/dining room, a living room, a control room and
									a toilet. There was also space for food storage, a
									small greenhouse, a bathroom, a sauna and even a gym.
									The Mars landing was scheduled for 12 February 2011,
									following a 255-day flight, and would involve a full
									two days of exploration of the planet's surface. An
									equally long return journey would see the astronauts
									return to Earth on 4 November 2011.
